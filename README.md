### :warning:<strong>Important notes (Read before proceeding, We recommend using VitalPBX 4 for HA):</strong></span><br>
If you already have your PBX in production and want to add High Availability, this method is the one you should use. However, the DRBD method is more recommended, which you can find in the following link:<br>
https://github.com/VitalPBX/vitalpbx4_drbd_ha

VitalPBX High Availability (VitalPBX Version 3)
=====
High availability is a characteristic of a system which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.<br>

Make a high-availability cluster out of any pair of VitalPBX servers. VitalPBX can detect a range of failures on one VitalPBX server and automatically transfer control to the other server, resulting in a telephony environment with minimal down time.<br>

### :warning:<strong>Important notes:</strong></span><br>
- Since DRBD is no longer used in version 3, it is not possible to migrate a High Availability VitalPBX from Version 2 to 3.<br>
- If you are going to restore some Backup from another server that is not in HA, restore it first in the Master server before creating the HA. This should be done as the backup does not contain the firewall rules for HA to work.<br>
- The VitalPBX team does not provide support for systems in an HA environment because it is not possible to determine the environment where it has been installed.

## Example:<br>
![VitalPBX HA](https://github.com/VitalPBX/vitalpbx_ha/blob/master/HAReplica2Servers.png)

-----------------
## Prerequisites
In order to install VitalPBX in high availability you need the following:<br>
a.- 3 IP addresses.<br>
b.- Install VitalPBX Version 3.0 in two servers with similar characteristics.<br>
c.- MariaDB Galera (include in VitalPBX 3).<br>
d.- Corosync, Pacemaker, PCS and lsyncd.<br>
e.- Root user is required for both servers to communicate.<br>
f.- Both servers will not be able to have a proxy since this affects the communication between them.

## Configurations
We will configure in each server the IP address and the host name. Go to the web interface to: <strong>Admin>System Settinngs>Network Settings</strong>.<br>
First change the Hostname, remember press the <strong>Check</strong> button.<br>
Disable the DHCP option and set these values<br>

| Name          | Master                 | Standby               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Hostname      | vitalpbx1.local        | vitalpbx2.local       |
| IP Address    | 192.168.10.61          | 192.168.10.62         |
| Netmask       | 255.255.255.0          | 255.255.255.0         |
| Gateway       | 192.168.10.1           | 192.168.10.1          |
| Primary DNS   | 8.8.8.8                | 8.8.8.8               |
| Secondary DNS | 8.8.4.4                | 8.8.4.4               |

## Bind Address
In the Master server go to SETTINGS/PJSIP Settings and configure the Floating IP that we are going to use in "Bind" and "TLS Bind".
Also do it in SETTINGS/SIP Settings Tab NETWORK fields "TCP Bind Address" and "TLS Bind Address".

## Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies on both servers<br>
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# yum -y install corosync pacemaker pcs lsyncd vitalpbx-high-availability
[root@vitalpbx2 ~]# yum -y install corosync pacemaker pcs lsyncd vitalpbx-high-availability
</pre>

## Create authorization key for the Access between the two servers without credentials

Create key in Server <strong>1</strong>
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# ssh-keygen -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N '' >/dev/null
[root@vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# ssh-copy-id root@<strong>192.168.10.62</strong>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <strong>yes</strong>
root@192.168.10.62's password: <strong>(remote server root’s password)</strong>

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@192.168.10.62'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added. 

[root@vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]#
</pre>

Create key in Server <strong>2</strong>
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx<strong>2</strong> ~]# ssh-keygen -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N '' >/dev/null
[root@vitalpbx<strong>2</strong> ~]# ssh-copy-id root@<strong>192.168.10.61</strong>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <strong>yes</strong>
root@192.168.10.61's password: <strong>(remote server root’s password)</strong>

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@192.168.10.61'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added. 

[root@vitalpbx<strong>2</strong> ~]#
</pre>

## Script
Now copy and run the following script<br>
<pre>
[root@ vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# mkdir /usr/share/vitalpbx/ha
[root@ vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# cd /usr/share/vitalpbx/ha
[root@ vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VitalPBX/vitalpbx_ha/master/vpbxha.sh
[root@ vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# chmod +x vpbxha.sh
[root@ vitalpbx<strong>1</strong> ~]# ./vpbxha.sh

## Change Servers Role

To execute the process of changing the role, we recommend using the following command:<br>

<pre>
[root@vitalpbx-master /]# bascul
************************************************************
*     Change the roles of servers in high availability     *
* <strong>WARNING-WARNING-WARNING-WARNING-WARNING-WARNING-WARNING</strong>  *
*All calls in progress will be lost and the system will be *
*     be in an unavailable state for a few seconds.        *
************************************************************
Are you sure to switch from vitalpbx<strong>1</strong>.local to vitalpbx<strong>2</strong>.local? (yes,no) >
</pre>

This action convert the vitalpbx<strong>1</strong>.local to Standby and vitalpbx<strong>2</strong>.local to Master. If you want to return to default do the same again.<br>

Next we will show a short video how high availability works in VitalPBX<br>
<div align="center">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yoa3KXKMy0"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/3yoa3KXKMy0/0.jpg" alt="High Availability demo video on VitalPBX"></a>
</div>

## Recommendations
If you have to turn off both servers at the same time, we recommend that you start by turning off the one in Standby and then the Master<br>
If the two servers stopped abruptly, always start first that you think you have the most up-to-date information and a few minutes later the other server<br>
If you want to update the version of VitalPBX we recommend you do it first on Server 1, then do a bascul and do it again on Server 2<br>

## Dahdi with Xorcom HA Hardware - Only install if you are using physical telephony cards
If you are going to install Dhadi with Xorcom HA Hardware we recommend you to execute the following commands in the Server <strong>1</strong>

<pre>
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# systemctl stop dahdi
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# systemctl disable dahdi
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs resource create dahdi service:dahdi op monitor interval=30s
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs cluster cib fs_cfg
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs cluster cib-push fs_cfg --config
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg constraint colocation add dahdi with virtual_ip INFINITY
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg constraint order lsyncd then dahdi
[root@vitalpbx1 ~]# pcs cluster cib-push fs_cfg --config
</pre>

and in the Server <strong>2</strong>

<pre>
[root@vitalpbx2 ~]# systemctl stop dahdi
[root@vitalpbx2 ~]# systemctl disable dahdi
</pre>

## Update VitalPBX version

To update VitalPBX to the latest version just follow the following steps:<br>
1.- From your browser, go to ip 192.168.10.60<br>
2.- Update VitalPBX from the interface<br>
3.- Execute the following command in Master console<br>
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx1 /]# bascul
</pre>
4.- From your browser, go to ip 192.168.10.60 again<br>
5.- Update VitalPBX from the interface<br>
6.- Execute the following command in Master console<br>
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx1 /]# bascul
</pre>

## Some useful commands
• <strong>bascul</strong>, is used to change roles between high availability servers. If all is well, a confirmation question should appear if we wish to execute the action.<br>
• <strong>role</strong>, shows the status of the current server. If all is well you should return Masters or Slaves.<br>
• <strong>pcs resource refresh --full</strong>, to poll all resources even if the status is unknown, enter the following command.<br>
• <strong>pcs cluster unstandby host</strong>, in some cases the bascul command does not finish tilting, which causes one of the servers to be in standby (stop), with this command the state is restored to normal.<br>

## If the databases lose synchronization
<pre>
[root@vitalpbx1 /]# mysql -uroot
mysql> STOP SLAVE;
mysql> SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1;
mysql> START SLAVE;
</pre>

## More Information
